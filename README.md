 <h1>Uber Fares Data Analysis Project</h1>
  </p>
This project was carried out by a student analyst to examine Uber ride data and uncover meaningful patterns in fare amounts, ride durations, and travel locations. Using Python for data cleaning and preparation, and Power BI for building visualizations, I manually explored and transformed the dataset to gain a clear understanding of ride behavior across different times of day, days of the week, and distances traveled. Feature engineering was done to extract relevant time-based attributes and support deeper analysis.<br><br>


With the cleaned and enhanced data, I created interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize fare distributions, detect peak hours, and analyze geographic patterns in ride activity. The findings from this human-led analysis aim to support smarter business decisions in areas like pricing strategy, driver allocation, and customer satisfaction. This project highlights how data science skills can be applied by individuals to solve real-world problems using structured data and visual storytellin
